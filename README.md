## Financial News Generation- LSTM model 
In this project, we will generate our own Financial News using RNNs. We will be using Financial news published by Bloomberg.com, CNBC.com, reuters.com, wsj.com and fortune.com as our training dataset. The Neural Network will then generate a new ,"fake" Financial News article, based on patterns it recognizes in this training dataset. Given an English sentence and the article length, the sample output of this project looks like below:
