And given that Gordon still sees the inverse relationship between EEM and the dollar, measured in his charts by the dollar-tracking ETF UUP , he believes the U.S. currency will continue to help the group. \\n\"We have a falling U.S. dollar, which will support international and emerging market currencies and will give those EEM stocks a boost,\" Gordon said Tuesday on CNBC\\'s \"Trading Nation.\" The U.S. dollar in 2017 posted its worst annual performance in 14 years, while EEM saw its best performance since 2013. \\nAs for how high the latter could go, Gordon says EEM has broken \"resistance\" at around $45, which was the ETF\\'s 2014 highs. That $45 region is now what he calls \"support,\" and he sees it rallying to $50, which the ETF hasn\\'t hit s\n"

    "**Answer:** To reach for our goal of less than 3.5 in loss, we need to run a training of at least 10 epochs. Increasing the hidden dimension from 512 to 1024 has proven to converge faster with loss of 3 versus 2.5 after 10 epochs. The ideal n_layers was found to be 2. Increasing the n_layer to 3 or higher did not make the model converge faster, and it actually did worse with loss value oscillating between 6 and 7 even after 5 epochs. The ideal learn rate was found to be 0.001, if 0.01 learn rate was used, the gradient descent overshoots causing the loss to increase by each epochs. If a much lower 0.0001 was used in training, the converge would be too slow, hence very inefficient. Changing the embedding dimension from 500 to 800 did not make any significant improvement in the model, so we will stick to the lower 500 embedding dimension. Increasing the sequence length to 50 made the model to converge slower, and it took almost 4 hours to finish running just 1 epoch. In our case we will use the average English sentences length, which is 15 words per sentence, hence sequence length is set to 15.   "
